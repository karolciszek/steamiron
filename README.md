Steamiron - smoothen your Daylio log!
=====================================

Daylio is a journaling app for mobile devices. Each journal entry
consists of a \'mood\' score as well as activities done that day and a
text journal entry.

The purpose of this project is to help you find trends in your journal
entries. Currently it consists of a script which calculates the rolling
average of your scores for each day.

How do I use it?
----------------

The script is simple so far - you need an exported CSV file present in
your directory. The output of the script will be a smoothened time
series graph. The days do not need to be consecutive.
